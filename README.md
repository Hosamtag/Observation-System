Follow tutorial at: https://closebrace.com/tutorials/2017-03-02/the-dead-simple-step-by-step-guide-for-front-end-developers-to-getting-up-and-running-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb in order to get Express, Node.JS and Mongo set up

After downloading code in this git repo, create collections in your mongo terminal using the command db.createCollection().
In other words you'll need to run db.createCollection("domains") db.createCollection("clusters") db.createCollection("needs") and db.createCollection("solutions").

When this code is downloaded from git, make sure to put it in the same file as "nodetest1" from the tutorial so that you can include it with the necessary "bin" and "node_modules" folders.
